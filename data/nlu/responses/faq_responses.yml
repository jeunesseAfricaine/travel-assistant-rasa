  utter_faq/ask_baggage_allowance:
    - text: Baggage allowances vary between airlines and ticket classes. It's
        advisable to check directly with your airline for specific baggage
        allowances and any associated fees or restrictions.
  utter_faq/ask_seat_selection:
    - text: Seat selection options might differ depending on the airline and the type
        of ticket purchased. Some airlines offer complimentary seat selection,
        while others may charge for this service. I recommend checking with your
        airline to understand their seat selection policy.
  utter_faq/ask_check_in_process:
    - text: You can usually check in for your flight through the airline's website,
        mobile app, or at the airport's check-in counters. Online check-in is
        available in most cases, starting 24 hours before the departure time.
        For more specific details, I suggest visiting the airline's website or
        contacting their customer service.
  utter_faq/ask_payment_methods:
    - text: We accept various payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, and
        online payment platforms. Please note that accepted payment methods may
        vary based on the airline and booking platform.
  utter_faq/ask_inflight_services:
    - text: Inflight services often include meals and entertainment. Some airlines
        also provide options for special meals upon request. However, specific
        services may vary by airline and the type of ticket purchased.
  utter_faq/ask_ticket_refund_policy:
    - text: Ticket refund policies differ among airlines and ticket types. Generally,
        refundability depends on the fare rules associated with the ticket. You
        may be eligible for a refund based on the fare conditions at the time of
        booking.
  utter_faq/ask_travel_insurance:
    - text: Travel insurance is not typically included in the ticket price. However,
        it can often be purchased separately during the booking process. It's
        recommended to review the coverage details before purchasing to
        understand what it includes.
    - text: Travel insurance is available and recommended to protect your travel
        investment. Many trips, such as tours and cruises, involve
        non-refundable funds paid months in advance. Travel insurance protects
        you from losing this investment. Perhaps even more important is the
        ‘during travel’ coverage and assistance that comes with the top-flight
        insurance companies we carry.
  utter_faq/ask_flight_delay_compensation:
    - text: Flight delay compensation policies vary by airline and region. In some
        cases, compensation may be provided for significant delays caused by the
        airline. Check the airline's policies or contact their customer service
        for specific details.

        you use the services of a travel assistant.
  utter_faq/ask_availability:
    - text: The sooner, the better. Whether it’s last minute or planned 18 months in
        advance, the more time you can give us, the better! You’ll need to be
        sure of a few details such as the dates (or date range) you wish to
        travel, the number of people in your travel party including the ages of
