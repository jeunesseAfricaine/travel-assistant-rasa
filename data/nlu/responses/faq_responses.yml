    - text: Baggage allowances vary between airlines and ticket classes. It's
        advisable to check directly with your airline for specific baggage
        allowances and any associated fees or restrictions.
  utter_faq/ask_check_in_process:
    - text: You can usually check in for your flight through the airline's website,
        mobile app, or at the airport's check-in counters. Online check-in is
        available in most cases, starting 24 hours before the departure time.
        For more specific details, I suggest visiting the airline's website or
        contacting their customer service.
  utter_faq/ask_travel_insurance:
    - text: Travel insurance is not typically included in the ticket price. However,
        it can often be purchased separately during the booking process. It's
        recommended to review the coverage details before purchasing to
        understand what it includes.
    - text: Travel insurance is available and recommended to protect your travel
        investment. Many trips, such as tours and cruises, involve
        non-refundable funds paid months in advance. Travel insurance protects
        you from losing this investment. Perhaps even more important is the
        ‚Äòduring travel‚Äô coverage and assistance that comes with the top-flight
        insurance companies we carry.
