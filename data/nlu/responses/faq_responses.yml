        advisable to check directly with your airline for specific baggage
        allowances and any associated fees or restrictions.
  utter_faq/ask_travel_insurance:
    - text: Travel insurance is not typically included in the ticket price. However,

        recommended to review the coverage details before purchasing to
        understand what it includes.

        investment. Many trips, such as tours and cruises, involve
        non-refundable funds paid months in advance. Travel insurance protects
        you from losing this investment. Perhaps even more important is the
        ‘during travel’ coverage and assistance that comes with the top-flight
        insurance companies we carry.
